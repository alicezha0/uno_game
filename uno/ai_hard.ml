(* This AI, player2, is not your normal player AI! 

   Similar to player, its priorities are, in order: 
   1. Calling Uno2 on the user
   2. Calling Uno for itself, then playing a playable card
   3. Playing a playable card
   4. Drawing if none of the above options are possible

   However, it's a lot more clever when playing cards. 
   1. If the last played card is +2 or +4, it will also play +2 or +4 if on hand
   2. If the user's hand size is 3 or less, it will choose to play action cards;
      if it is greater than that, it will save its action cards
   3. Wildcards are played only if there is no other option, and if played, 
      it will choose the color it has most of in hand

   In cases of multiple playable cards, it prioritizes playing the first card 
   of the same color, then playing the first card of the same number.

   This AI calls Uno and Uno2 when appropriate without fail. *)
