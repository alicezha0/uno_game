  "rules": "Here are the rules for our Uno -
  
  Both you and the AI are dealt 7 cards (either Number, Action cards, or Wild cards).
  The rest placed in the Draw pile. The top card of the Draw pile begins the Discard pile. 
  Try to match the card on top of the Discard pile by number, color, or action. 
  If you have no matches, you must draw a card from the Draw pile. 
  
  This continues until you have two cards left. On that turn, you must play 'Uno'. 
  If you do not play 'Uno' and the AI plays 'Uno' on their next turn, you will draw 
  two new cards as penalty. Similarly, if The AI does not play 'Uno' on the turn they 
  have two cards left and you play 'Uno' on your turn, the AI will draw 
  two new cards as penalty. The player who plays all cards in their hands first wins."
